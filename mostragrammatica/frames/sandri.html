  		<p>Giuseppe Sandri was born in Faedo, Trento, on 26 August 1946. On the 30th of May he died after a short illness of two months. From 27 March to 30 May he was admitted to hospital due to a perforated ulcer. He was 72 years old when the Lord called him to himself on the Ascension Feast. He died in the early hours of the day. <br><br>

On the 15th of August 1971, he made his perpetual profession in the Institute of Comboni Missionaries of the Heart of Jesus, after his theological studies in the United States, where he obtained a master's degree in Theology. He was ordained on 27 May 1972 and shortly afterwards left for South Africa, as a missionary. He worked for several years in pastoral work in the diocese of Lydenburg-Witbank, in the north of the country. During these years of pastoral work, he was involved in various works and in particular coordinating the work of translating the Bible into the local language, Xitsonga, which he knew well. In 1992 he was elected provincial superior of the Comboni missionaries in South Africa. In 1999 he was called to Rome to work in the general administration as secretary general until 2007. In 2007 he returned to South Africa and was again elected provincial superior, a ministry he exercised for only two years because at the end of 2009 the Holy Father appointed him bishop of the diocese of Witbank. On 31 January he was ordained bishop in Maria Trost, Lydenburg, the first mission of the Comboni missionaries in South Africa. He took over the leadership of the diocese, replacing Bishop Paul Khumalo.<br><br>

From that day on, Bishop Joseph Sandri placed himself entirely at the service of God's people in Mpumalanga as their pastor. He tirelessly visited the Christian communities, supported and accompanied the priests in their ministry, promoted the different vocations, encouraged the laity to be protagonists of evangelization, keeping in mind the Comboni motto:  save Africa with Africa.</p>
