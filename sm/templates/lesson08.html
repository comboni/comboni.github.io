    Introduction
  </div>
  <p class="item item-text-wrap">
    One of the objectives of learning religious studies in schools is to enable the learner use the acquired social, spiritual and moral insights to think critically and make appropriate moral decisions in a rapidly changing society (KIE, 2005:74). Religious stories can provide students with these critical skills. </p>

<br><br>4. Create quizzes to assess students’ knowledge about religious differences. 
<br><br>5. Display photographs of different holy sites and pictures that are symbolic representations of various religious practices and beliefs (e.g. the Catholic rosary). Let the students have an open discussion about the religious sites and symbols. Let them talk about what they feel about the symbols and sites.
<br><br>6. Visit a sacred site near your school (e.g. a mosque, a church or a shrine) and let the students discuss their attachment to the sites. This helps the students to understand the importance of holy sites and their own religious beliefs in nonthreatening ways.

In a nutshell, religious stories can help in evangelization and in inculcating religious values which are key ingredients for peace building. Religious stories bring us together and establish a common standpoint, stamping a shared identity and often a common loyalty. If the story about the Good Samaritan is told to our grand children as it was told to us by our grandparents, it can cement a bond across generations. In addition, they help us revisit our own religious traditions in order to uncover concepts and values that promote a more open and compassionate attitude to other human beings, thus aiding education for peace. 
<br><br>12. Integrating religious stories while teaching Christian Religious Education (CRE). According to Feinberg (2004:2), religious stories are able to consolidate a people, shaping their identity, expand their identity into a larger, worldlier community. It can also re-constitute our moral identity in a specifically religious way and redefine what it means to be a moral person. The stories are embedded with laws and ideas that provide civilization with religious commitments to critical peace-related values, including empathy, an openness to and even love for strangers, the suppression of unbridled ego and acquisitiveness, human rights, unilateral gestures of forgiveness, and humanity, interpersonal repentance and acceptance of responsibility of the past errors as a means of reconciliation and the drive for social justice. These laws create a shared ethical space for community of believers and provide norms and principles for a moral stance in life. It also provides moral warrants for resistance against unjust conditions, including those conditions that give rise to conflicts. It also offers normative symbols of the religious meaning of peace and human responsibility to strive for peace.

    Conclusion
  </div>
  <p class="item item-text-wrap">
    In this lesson, we have learnt ways through which teachers can tap the strength of religious diversity to create peace. This is important because Religions all over the world are on a war path. The dominant are constantly trying to suppress the dominated. This has led to each claiming to be the ‘container’ or ‘deposit’ for predetermined truth. This has resulted in religious intolerance with some people claiming to be the ‘defenders’ of their religious truths (Magesa, 2010). The end result is unprecedented conflict as is now being witnessed in Central African Republic and in Northern Nigeria.  As a consequence, the question of interfaith dialogue is now paramount in the search for sustainable peace and development.
