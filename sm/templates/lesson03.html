    Advice from elderly people
  </div>
  <p class="item item-text-wrap">
    Elders advise and supervise the younger generations. When I was young, I used to accompany my grandfather when grazing. He would counsel me on how to take care of cattle, the kind of stick to use when herding and how to tell that a cow has fed well.  This makes one strong point. It underlines the indispensable role of elders in passing on to younger generations knowledge of “how things should be done” in society.

    Indigenous narratives
  </div>
  <p class="item item-text-wrap">
    Myths, stories, proverbs and riddles as a source of information on indigenous peace knowledge. They have entertaining and instructive values which constitute the most popular and most important form of oral literature. Apart from fulfilling the normal artist creativity and aesthetic functions, they have morals to convey to the listeners while at the same time they play important valuable education and informative roles. According to Ociti (1972), in the indigenous setting children learnt by listening to myths, legends, folk-tales, proverbs, riddles and folk songs, rhymes, and other aspects of oral literature. In the deep well of folk-lore were found moral messages, histories, wisdom and philosophy or outlook into life of each clan (p. 103).

    Indigenous symbols such as peace trees and sacred sites are very important in peace building. These are the last remaining symbols of the tradition that maintained peace among communities and harmony with the environment.

<div class="card">
  <div class="item item-divider item-text-wrap dark tit_3">
    Indigenous songs, dances, and ceremonies
  </div>
  <p class="item item-text-wrap">
    Indigenous songs, the dances and the ceremonies have important peace values they unconsciously instill upon children on listening. According to Boulding’s (2000) celebrations are the play life of a society, occasions for embodying the experienced beauty of both inner and outer lifeworlds in song, dance, poetry and the creation of symbolic imagery. They are also occasions for reaffirmation of identity and social values. At their best, feasting and gift giving emphasize sharing and reciprocity, a scene of the community as one family. Celebrations are a powerful reinforcement of peaceful and caring community relations. It is a time for letting go of grudges, of reconciliation among persons whose relations have become strained (p.103). A good example is the bull fighting ceremony among the Luhya people where the entire community comes together to celebrate the winning bull.<br><br>
	
	Boulding (2000) further observes that the quality of the peace culture in any given society can be found in its art forms. The visual, the kinetic, and the audio arts are interpenetrating expressions of joys, sorrows, and spiritual intuitions of humans as they participate in the lifeworlds of the planet and beyond. Art forms that enhance the capacity of the human senses for experiencing and relating to those lifeworlds are part of the core of a society’s peace culture. Art forms that constrict the capacity to relate to those lifeworlds reflect on the other hand, a culture of violence (p. 103).

    Greetings
  </div>
  <p class="item item-text-wrap">
     Peace is used in everyday greetings in many cultures. To begin the day you have to greet others. It is not good to wake up early in the morning and begin to quarrel. When you greet others, you wish them peace and well-being. And they do the same in turn. Even if you want to fight in the morning, you have to suspend the fight until you have greeted the people. When you begin the day with a quarrel, you may be sure you have spoilt your whole day. This illustrates how greetings relate to peace. They help in building relationships.

     Sporting activities help in promoting collaboration, cooperation, interdependence, communication skills, fair play and justice and the need to abide by rules. Sporting activities are an ignition of creative imagination which would be the motor of all future thoughts and reason. According to Boulding (2000), sporting activities allow the imagination of children to explore alternatives to everyday reality. These alternatives may be thought of as images of possible futures. A society that encourages the play of the mind encourages the exploration of other and better ways of ordering life ways (p. 105).

  <em>
    This chapter presents findings of an exploration on how teachers mainstream indigenous peace knowledge in the curriculum. It reports findings of a case
    study involving fifty six primary school teachers from Kariobangi and Korogocho in Nairobi, Kenya. The teachers' responses reveal that they are able to
    develop meanings about peace through symbolic interactionism. The meanings teachers develop correspond with the already prescribed social meaning about
    peace, which has been passed on from generation to generation. Teachers demonstrated that they have internalized this meaning and use this
    understanding to build peace in schools. Teachers expressed various understandings in regard to the term peace. They also demonstrated how they employ
    this knowledge in peace building. The overall picture generated by this research is that peace building through indigenous knowledge cannot be
    underrated and should be a crucial way forward in all levels of learning in Kenya. A narrow conception of indigenous peace knowledge and its importance
    in peace building by teachers could be responsible for the increase of violence in schools and society in general.

  Introduction
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  In 2007, I was involved in conducting peace education lessons in primary schools in Nairobi. I was given ninety-five minutes per week to offer peace
  education to the standard seven classes. The lesson took place every Wednesday from 11.30 am to 12.45 pm. Previously, pupils were left free to do their own
  work during this time period. As the term came to a close, some teachers complained to the head teacher that the peace education class was a waste of time
  since pupils could not be examined in that subject area. The head teacher, however, insisted that the peace education class should continue because he felt
  that it is good for Kenyans to learn about peace and that this type of education is rarely learnt by children from their elders. After listening to the
  teachers' complaints and talking to some, I realized that the problem was on syllabus constrains. Some teachers had not exhaustively covered what they had
  set to cover by the beginning of the term. I realized that if teachers could be taught on how to mainstream peace across curriculum, they would be more
  effective than an outsider. This prompted me to undertake a study to establish teachers understanding of peace and how they employ these understanding to
  build peace in schools.
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  <strong>Teachers Understanding of the Term Peace</strong>
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  The first aspect of inquiry in this study was teachers understanding of the term peace. Teachers were asked to explain in a questionnaire their
  understanding of the term peace. The purpose of this question was to explore the meaning teachers have generated about peace in their experience with their
  indigenous traditions in their day to day experiences and misconceptions, if any, they have about peace. The study assumed that because of their position
  in society teachers experience indigenous traditions through their interaction with the grassroots people; they experience ubiquitous conflicts and
  participate in building peace in one way or the other. In the process, they participate in generating meaning on what peace entails.
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  Fifty two teachers responded to the question. Their responses revealed that teachers understand peace in three different ways. To some, peace is absence of
  violence. By this, they meant absence of open physical harm to persons and to property which emanates from riots in schools. The sentiments below include
  and sum up the responses and the views of the others:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p lang="en-US" align="justify">
      It is an act of being not in war with anybody
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="en-US" align="justify">
      Is a mood of silence; when there is no conflict or war
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="en-US" align="justify">
      No conflicting issues
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  According to Assefa (1996), this conception of peace holds that the maintenance of law and order and the pursuit of stability are primarily objectives of
  peace. In this understanding of peace, the absence of visible (overt) violence in schools provides an indicator of successful peace and peace building.
  When there is no violence in schools, then there is peace (p.43). Caning and corporal punishments are usually the instruments used to bring about and
  enforce this 'type of peace' in schools. This is a view held by many teachers. Reacting to the ban on the use of the cane in schools in March 2001, the
  former Vice-Chancellor of Kenyatta University Prof. George Eshiwani argued that the ban was to blame for the unrest in schools. He appealed to the Ministry
  of Education to rescind the decision if discipline was to be restored in schools (Sunday Nation, Nairobi, 5 August 2001).
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  The former Starehe Boys' Centre Director, Dr Geoffrey Griffins, held a similar view. He took issue with the way the ban was issued, saying the Government
  was bowing to international pressure and that little consideration was made of the implications. With day schools, Dr Griffins explained, the head teachers
  could afford to summon parents to sort out problems associated with their children. But it was difficult to involve parents in boarding schools because of
  logistics. He said corporal punishment was quick and efficient as reported in the Daily Nation.
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  If you are dealing with 1,000 adolescents, a number of them are likely to be involved in misdemeanors which can only be corrected by the professional use
  of the cane&#8230;A teacher in a boarding school is a surrogate parent and is obliged to ensure discipline is upheld. After all, if it is not against the
  law for parents to use the cane on their children, why should the same power be taken away from teachers? (Daily Nation, January 5, 2006).
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  In April 2006, a teacher went to court seeking re-introduction of the cane in schools. According to the teacher, the ban on the use of the cane has
  stripped teachers authority to enforce discipline in schools hence an increase in indiscipline cases (Daily Nation, April 5, 2006).
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  Kenya banned the use of cane in schools in 2001 after being cited at the world conference on Education for All in Dakar in 2000 as having institutionalized
  violence and promoted child abuse by including corporal punishment in its statutes. In a gazette notice dated March 13, 2001 the then Minister for
  Education Mr. Kalonzo Musyoka scrapped sections of the law that permitted corporal punishment. Paragraph 11 read: "Corporal punishment may be inflicted
  only in cases of continued or grave neglect of work, lying, bullying, gross insubordination, indecency, truancy or the like." Sections 12, 13 and 14 spelt
  out the mode of meting out the punishment and designated the head teacher or his/her appointee as the ones to inflict it. All these four paragraphs were
  deleted in the new law. In the new amendment, Mr Musyoka explained that the words "other than corporal punishment" must be inserted after every mention of
  the word "punishment" in the Act. This was intended to clarify any doubt about the nature of punishment to be meted out on delinquent students (Daily
  Nation, Nairobi, 11 April 2001).
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  Assefa (1996) however, finds a shortcoming in this conception of peace. It preoccupies itself with controlling overt violence. This, he observes, may
  condone or perpetrate more covert violence arising from unjust, repressive and oppressive punishments (p. 43). According to Dr. Griffin as reported in
  Daily Nation, schools that over-use the cane make students resent the discipline measure and become violent. He attributed good performance of his school
  to freedom of movement and speech. "We ensure an environment in which discipline and punishment are not synonymous and pupils are orderly, happy and free
  from undue stress" (Daily Nation, Nairobi, 24<sup>th</sup> August, 2000).
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  For others, peace was viewed as a condition of calmness where there is no disagreement or disputes, conflicts and people, individually and collectively,
  live in peace and quietness. Examples of such responses include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p lang="en-US" align="justify">
      Peace means living in harmony with others in society
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="en-US" align="justify">
      When there is no disturbance, smooth running of an event
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="en-US" align="justify">
      Is stability
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="en-US" align="justify">
      When the environment is conducive
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  According to Assefa (1996), this conception fails to recognize conflict as a fact of life. He argues that instead of acknowledging its existence and
  learning to use appropriate mechanisms to deal with it, this conception can lead people into misguided perception that if you avoid conflict, it will go
  away (p. 43).
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  For still others, peace goes beyond a preoccupation with the absence of conflict or violence. It is seen as the transformation of conflictual and
  destructive interaction into more cooperative and constructive relationship. This understanding equates peace with conflict transformation and resolution.
  In this view, peace is not simply a state of general tranquility or an imposed order that suppress discord, but rather a network of relationships full of
  energy and differences. Examples of some of the responses include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p lang="en-US" align="justify">
      Loving one another and working together as a team
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="en-US" align="justify">
      Understanding or accepting one another
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="en-US" align="justify">
      From the Biblical point of view, peace is the seedbed of righteousness and so is my understanding. When people live in harmony, unity, love without
      conflicts and problems resulting from poor interpersonal relationships they live in an environment termed to be peaceful
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  According to Assefa (1996), in this conception of peace, structures are available through which personal and social differences can be identified and
  worked out in ways satisfactorily to all involved parties as well as to the society at large. Sometimes in this process, the status quo may be disturbed or
  long-standing structures may be shaken; but this definition maintains that peace is achieved only when the root causes of the differences or conflictual
  relationships are explored and resolved (p. 43).
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  Notwithstanding, the responses suggested that teachers are aware of what peace entails. This is important because teachers cannot champion something that
  is inadequately understood and conceptualized. Narrow conception of the term may influence the way they build peace in schools.
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  <strong>Cultural understanding of peace </strong>
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  <a name="_Toc145741931"></a>
  The other aspect of inquiry was to establish teachers' conception of peace through their cultural worldview. This was done through a questionnaire and the
  interviews. The aim of this question was to explore whether teachers have some knowledge about peace which they have acquired through their interaction
  with their indigenous cultures. This was important because teachers cannot champion something that is inadequately understood and conceptualized. The same
  applies to peace. Teachers cannot educate for peace if they have not adequately understood and conceptualized it. The question assumed that teachers have
  interacted with their indigenous cultures for a considerable length of time by either being brought up or having lived in rural areas, having participated
  in cultural activities such as rituals or ceremonies or having interacted with the grassroots people in one way or the other and are able to acquire some
  knowledge about peace through this interaction. Fifty one teachers responded to the question. Their responses revealed that the majority of the teachers
  are aware of their indigenous cultures.
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  <strong>Sources of cultural peace knowledge</strong>
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  The study also explored through a questionnaire where teachers learnt these peace cultures. The aim of this question was to establish avenues through which
  teachers learn peace cultures. Learning institutions were identified as a major source and conduit of peace cultures. By learning institutions, they were
  referring to schools, colleges and universities. Teachers' responses revealed that there were many opportunities through which teachers as students were
  exposed to indigenous cultural knowledge. This is because learning institutions bring together people from various cultural backgrounds and there are
  numerous opportunities through which these cultural mosaics interact hence transmitting cultural knowledge. They gave examples of cultural activities such
  as inter-cultural competitions among pupils, cultural dances and other informal interactions that schools used to organize. This concurs with what Datta
  (1984) observes regarding the role of learning institutions in preserving and passing on of culture from generation to generation (p. 33). It is also in
  line with what the Government requires of learning institutions in Kenya.
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  Elders were ranked second. Teachers were of the view that elders still participate in generating life through their experience, which they pass on to
  younger ones. They know how life comes about and how it ought to be preserved and passed on. Fugleang (1982) describes elders as the "information storage
  and processing unit" of a society, like the hard drive on a computer (p. 2). Throughout history, elders have helped communities to build and maintain peace
  by teaching indigenous values and virtues, which enhanced African morality and community life. Evidence indicates that many cases were (and still are)
  resolved and reconciled by elders after other means failed. They are thus accorded maximum respect for their wisdom.
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  Books were ranked third in the transmission of cultural knowledge. Teachers cited books such as Facing Mount Kenya by Jomo Kenyatta and Ngugi wa Thiongo's
  The River Between. History books were also identified as a source of cultural knowledge. The reason for this could be that the research respondents are
  literate and are able to read on their own. At the same time, teachers are expected to be widely well read so that they have the ability to make pupils
  understand their environment and their cultures as is required by the school curriculum.
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  One teacher mentioned the media as a source of cultural knowledge. By this he meant the print media, radio, and television.
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  <em>
    If you stand along the road to most of the slums in Nairobi and look on top of the houses, you will find that most of the houses have a TV aerial. This
    means that most likely, there is a TV set in that house. You will also find magazines and newspapers on sale along the way. Again, almost every
    household has an FM radio. This shows how much influence the media has on people living in this area.
  </em>
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  This underlies the important role media plays in transmitting values within society. As Schultze (1994) has noted, media is currently competing directly
  with parents, pastors and teachers for the job of raising children. At the same time, traditional authority figures are increasingly distraught over the
  apparent power of the media to shape the youth's values and beliefs (p. 17).
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  Five teachers suggested that they learnt these cultures from their peers. They recalled their childhood days and how this came to shape their lives.
  According to Datta (1984), a peer group shelters and protects its members. It gives them psychological sustenance by meeting emotional needs of affection,
  understanding and acceptance. Peer groups provide an effective learning situation: it transmits the culture of society, teaches certain roles and social
  expectations and conditions the attitudes and sentiments of its members (p. 67).
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  <a name="_Toc145741932"></a>
  One teacher identified peace clubs as a source of information on peace culture. By peace clubs, he meant voluntary associations or extracurricular
  movements within school that are aimed at building peace. Through clubs, students learn many things not necessarily about what their teachers intend them
  to learn. The students can decide on the activities to undertake as well as the timing. There is also minimum external pressure and the activities could be
  confined to a single theme, usually from the members' interests. He said that the club was initiated by a local NGO and is engaged in a number of
  activities all aimed at building peace in their school. The NGO also provided some sporting materials to be used in sporting activities as one way of
  building peace. The members of the club are also engaged in activities such as discussions, volunteer service, and peace competitions.
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  <strong>Examples of Peace Cultures</strong>
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  The study went further to explore whether teachers are able to pinpoint some of these peace cultures. The aim of this question was to explore what aspects
  of indigenous cultures teachers consider to be of value in building peace in schools. This is important because there are aspects of the indigenous
  cultures that could propagate and promote violence rather than peace. For instance, some pastoralist traditions emphasize warrior-hood and strong exercise
  of patriarchal authority. These may not be oriented towards peace building. The question therefore aimed at understanding the misconception teachers could
  have on indigenous peace cultures. What do they consider to be a peace culture? What values do these peace cultures promote? These misconceptions may lead
  to generation of negative meanings about peace.
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  Four teachers suggested advice from elderly people. They recalled the many times they have received advice from elders. One teacher recounted this during
  the interview:
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  <em>
    When I was young, I used to accompany my grandfather when grazing. He would counsel me on how to take care of cattle, the kind of stick to use when
    herding and how to tell that a cow has fed well.
  </em>
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  This shows that elders advise and supervise the younger generations. Bujo (1998) illustrates how elders' advice is indispensable with an etiological story
  of the Alur (Eastern Congo-Kinshasa). A chief's son who was installed as a successor after his father's death, ordered his subjects to kill all old men.
  One day, the chief's life was in danger. A big snake had wound itself around his neck, threatening to suffocate him. On the third day, his cousin visited
  his father, informed him about the chief's dangerous situation and asked for advice. The father told him to look for a frog or mouse and throw it in front
  of the snake, which would by then be starving. It would then unwind itself from the chief's neck so as to catch the frog. This would then offer a good
  opportunity to kill it and free the chief.
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  This advice was successful, and after being freed, the chief asked the cousin where he had obtained the wisdom. When he heard that an old man who had
  escaped from the execution he had ordered was behind it, he invited him to his court. The old man severely reproached the chief because of his disrespect
  to the elders (p. 199). The story makes one strong point. It underlines the indispensable role of elders in passing on to younger generation knowledge of
  "how things should be done" in society. As Ba (2006) asserts, when an old person dies it is like when a library burns down (p.2).
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  Thirteen teachers suggested myths, stories, proverbs and riddles as a source of information on indigenous peace knowledge. They highlighted their
  entertaining and instructive values which constitute the most popular and most important form of oral literature. They noted that apart from fulfilling the
  normal artist creativity and aesthetic functions, they have morals to convey to the listeners while at the same time they play important valuable education
  and informative roles. According to Ociti (1972), in the indigenous setting children learnt by listening to myths, legends, folk-tales, proverbs, riddles
  and folk songs, rhymes, and other aspects of oral literature. In the deep well of folk-lore were found moral messages, histories, wisdom and philosophy or
  outlook into life of each clan (p. 103).
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  Three teachers suggested indigenous symbols such as peace trees and sacred sites, and their importance in peace building. They recalled a reconciliation
  meeting held in Kariobangi after the Kariobangi killings in 2002 that claimed over twenty lives (Daily Nation, March 3, 2002).<em> </em>They learnt how
  peace trees and sacred sites are used in peace building in different ethnic groups throughout Kenya. They said that peace tree seedlings were used as
  symbols of reconciliation during this meeting. The trees were used during peace and reconciliation ceremonies in these communities. The survivors from
  different ethnic groups exchanged peace trees with those believed to be the perpetrators of the massacre. Those who lost their family members took with
  them peace trees to plant at the gravesite of the deceased as a symbol of reconciliation and forgiveness. They also established a peace tree garden in
  Kariobangi as a symbol of reconciliation among the Kariobangi community.
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  According to Somjee (2002) this is a heritage of human values handed down to generations by people who have lived close to earth and neither modern
  education nor the modern state has the capacity to impart or replace this heritage. They are the last remaining symbols of the tradition that maintained
  peace among communities and harmony with the environment (pp. 16 -18). He further notes:
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  <em>
    Among many ethnic communities in East Africa, peace among people is linked to peace with the earth. People pray under trees, use foliage of peace trees
    during rites of passage and inhale the smoke of the sacred wood in blessing rituals. They bless the earth with branches dipped in water, milk and
    honey. Today, clergy of the Catholic Church in Ukambani, Embu and Pokot regions dip leaves of the sacred tree into the holy water and sprinkle it on
    the congregation and the earth. (P. 17).
  </em>
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  Fifteen teachers suggested indigenous songs, dances, and ceremonies as a source of information on indigenous peace knowledge. The teachers were of the view
  that the songs, the dances and the ceremonies have important peace values they unconsciously instill upon children on listening. The teachers' responses
  concur with Boulding's (2000) observation regarding the role of ceremonies in peace building (pp.102 -103). He observes that celebrations are the play life
  of a society, occasions for embodying the experienced beauty of both inner and outer lifeworlds in song, dance, poetry and the creation of symbolic
  imagery. They are also occasions for reaffirmation of identity and social values. At their best, feasting and gift giving emphasize sharing and
  reciprocity, a scene of the community as one family. Celebrations are a powerful reinforcement of peaceful and caring community relations. It is a time for
  letting go of grudges, of reconciliation among persons whose relations have become strained (p.103).
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  Boulding (2000) further observes that the quality of the peace culture in any given society can be found in its art forms. The visual, the kinetic, and the
  audio arts are interpenetrating expressions of joys, sorrows, and spiritual intuitions of humans as they participate in the lifeworlds of the planet and
  beyond. Art forms that enhance the capacity of the human senses for experiencing and relating to those lifeworlds are part of the core of a society's peace
  culture. Art forms that constrict the capacity to relate to those lifeworlds reflect on the other hand, a culture of violence (p. 103).

  One teacher pinpointed greetings as a peace tradition. Peace is a frequent word for greetings. Among the Maasai, a Cushitic community in both Kenya and
  Tanzania, the word for peace is <em>Osotua. Osotua </em>also means beauty. This why Maasai say 'there is no beauty when there is no peace', and vice versa.
  This is also a frequent word for greetings. The Ameru, a Bantu community in Central Kenya refers to peace as <em>thiiri</em> in normal conversation. During
  prayers, peace is expressed as either <em>thiiri</em> or <em>thaai. </em>This is the response chanted after every utterance by the prayer leader. Kikuyu
  refer to peace as <em>thayu</em>. This is the term used to describe a situation of social calm and unity. The Luo, a Nilotic community in both Kenya and
  Uganda refer to peace as <em>'kwe.</em>' This is the same word used in greetings. The Ganda of Uganda refers to peace as <em>mirembe</em>. Luhya of Kenya
  refers to it as <em>murembe</em>. The two words are also used in greetings.
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  The Marakwet refer to peace as <em>Kalyet</em>. The term refer to harmony that comes about when the community enjoys good health, there is plenty of food
  and fodder for livestock. The term is also used in greetings. The Ndebele of Zimbambwe use the word <em>ukuthula. </em>The term denotes calmness and
  quietness that comes about when there is peace. The Akamba of Kenya refers to peace as <em>muuo</em>. The word refers to goodness and calmness. <em> </em>
Gabra of Kenya refers to peace as<em> nagay.</em> This is the response chanted after every utterance by the prayer leader. Bemba of Zambia refers to it as  <em>umutende</em> which means calmness. This is a common tradition in many African cultures.
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  According to Nkoyoyo (1999), in Africa, when you greet others, you wish them peace and well-being and they respond in the same way. When you begin the day
  with a quarrel, you spoil your whole day. In many African cultures, if you pass an elder without greeting him or her, it is considered disrespectful. If
  somebody habitually avoids greeting others, s/he excommunicates himself from the community (p. 22). Among the Gabra, if a visitor fails to greet people he
  meets in a <em>manyatta</em> (a traditional homestead) he runs the probability of not being welcomed. He is considered a witch (Mosala, 2003). Greetings
  therefore reveal the heart and the mind of the African people. This implies that African people desire peace. It is stated everywhere, in every activity,
  at virtually every hour of the day. It is embedded in the structure of their language.

<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  Two teachers suggested sporting activities. They observed that sporting activities help in promoting collaboration, cooperation, interdependence,
  communication skills, fair play and justice and the need to abide by rules. Sporting activities are an ignition of creative imagination which would be the
  motor of all future thoughts and reason. According to Boulding (2000), sporting activities allow the imagination of children to explore alternatives to
  everyday reality. These alternatives may be thought of as images of possible futures. A society that encourages the play of the mind encourages the
  exploration of other and better ways of ordering life ways (p. 105).

  <strong>How Teachers Employ peace knowledge to build peace in schools </strong>
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  The other aspect of inquiry was on how teachers employ indigenous peace knowledge in building peace in schools. Teachers were asked both through a
  questionnaire and during the interview to state whether and how they employ indigenous peace knowledge in building peace in schools. The question assumed
  that teachers respond to conflicts on the basis of the indigenous meaning they have about peace. Having experienced their indigenous traditions for a
  considerable length of time, the possibilities are that the teachers would respond to conflicts on the basis of the existing 'social meaning' about peace.
  The social meaning in this case refers to the already prescribed meaning about peace, which has been passed on from generation to generation. The teacher
  has internalized this and uses this understanding either the way it is or modifies it to suit the prevailing situations.
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  The responses revealed that teachers do employ indigenous knowledge in peace building in various ways. For some, they employ this knowledge when resolving
  conflicts. Some of the responses include:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p lang="en-US" align="justify">
      In cases when there is some misunderstanding between two pupils you help them resolve their differences by giving them counseling.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="en-US" align="justify">
      When settling a dispute between disagreeing pupils you hold a discussion with them so as to develop some consensus on the contentious issues.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="en-US" align="justify">
      When need arises, especially where the pupils apply brawl instead of brain in resolving their differences you send them home to bring their parents
      so that the parent can participate in counseling the child.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="en-US" align="justify">
      When a child does something wrong you call him and explain to him/her that what she did was wrong.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="en-US" align="justify">
      Whenever there is a conflict between pupils, a teacher calls the parties together and hears from both sides and the parties then come to a common
      understanding after a discussion.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="en-US" align="justify">
      When children fight, the teacher explains to them how they could have solved the problem amicably without resorting to violence.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  The responses reveal that teachers do not simply respond to conflicts because it has occurred but are involved in proactive teaching about how pupils
  should live in peace with each other. This teaching is not written down. It is clearly known to both the teachers and the pupils. It is stated everywhere,
  in every activity, at virtually every hour of the day. It is embedded in the structure of their language.
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  For others, they employ indigenous knowledge when teaching in class. Some of the responses they gave include:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p lang="en-US" align="justify">
      In class while teaching conflict and resolution topics in social studies. We normally start such lessons by discussing some of the indigenous
      traditions that were used to bring peace in different communities before discussing the recent modern techniques
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="en-US" align="justify">
      When teaching, we incorporate indigenous knowledge by telling a story or a riddle
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p lang="en-US" align="justify">
      During our Christian Religious Education lessons and social studies. We teach them how peace was being promoted in African traditional society when
      there were disagreements between people in the society
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  The responses reveal that teachers do not merely teach for academic purposes. They also pass on life values necessary for keeping conflicts to a minimum.
  These values not only help pupils in understanding their environment but also direct pupils on what the society considers to be right or wrong so as to
  build peace. They also direct them on how they should respond to any conflict that does occur. The responses also reveal that resolving conflicts is not
  merely clarifying what is right and what is wrong. It involves teaching pupils what they should do as members of the society. There may be clarification of
  what is right and wrong but such clarification seems to be secondary to lessons learnt in practical storytelling about the kind of things that would happen
  if the pupils continue to do what the school and the society considers as wrong. This confirms that schools play a role in inculcating societal norms to
  pupils.
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  Storytelling featured prominently as one way through which teachers employ indigenous peace knowledge in peace building. This could be because storytelling
  is interesting and persuasive teaching skill whereby teachers create the environment in which the story is told. It also entertains children and is capable
  of holding children's attention by mirroring real life at the same time teaching important concepts, attitudes and skills. Moreover, it provides
  opportunities for child participation, for retelling and repetition of the story, and for deeper understanding. Achebe (1987) has correctly observed that a
  storyteller weaves the fabric of the memory so life takes on meaning.
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  <em>
    It is only the story that can continue beyond the war and the warrior. It is the story that outlives the sound of the war-drums and the exploits of the
    brave fighters. It is the story&#8230;.that saves our progeny from blundering like blind beggars into the spikes of the cactus fence. The story is our
    escort; without it, we are blind. Does the blind man own his escort? No, neither do we the story; rather it is the story that owns us and directs us
    (p. 2).
  </em>
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  According to Ayindo et al (2001), we shape our world through stories. We transform not just the narrative but also the world around us. Through the stories
  of a people you hear the music of their triumphs, failures, frustrations and despair in the quest to make the world more human. It is by telling stories
  that we become makers of history rather than objects of it. It is through storytelling that we enhance a culture of peace (p. 3).
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  Numerous storytellers, scholars and other professionals support the view that stories bear the seeds of peace and reconciliation, both because a feel for
  story is part of what it means to be human and because of the inherent narrative nature of conflict. Negler (n.d.) sees violence as a failure of
  imagination (p. 2). Storytelling harnesses the imagination, exalts the individual and employs wisdom and love to address problems both before and after
  violence erupts.
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  During the interview I asked teachers to recall a story they narrated to pupils that was aimed at building peace. One teacher from Kariobangi primary
  school gave me a story he narrated to pupils after one pupil stabbed another with a knife. The story went like this:
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  <em>
    Once upon a time, there was a stupid rich man who always ignored simple issues. One day, he organized a party to celebrate his birthday. He invited
    very important people to come and grace the occasion. He also prepared some traditional beer for his visitors. In the morning, he called his cook and
    asked to be given some little beer to taste and ascertain whether it is ready. As the cook was serving the beer, some spilled on the ground.
  </em>
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  "<em>Oh, what a mess. Let me wipe this up", offered the cook.</em>
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  "<em>Ah, never mind," said the rich man. "It is not our problem. The servants will wipe it up before the party begins." </em>
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  <em>
    As the two continued chatting and sipping their beer, the spilled beer slowly started dripping down the podium. Soon, a fly landed on the drop and
    begun his own meal. A gecko that was hiding on pieces of wood under the podium sprang out and with a flip from its long tongue swallowed the fly. But a
    cat that was resting just nearby saw the gecko and pounced on it. This disturbed a sleeping dog nearby that rose for a duel. Soon, a fight ensued
    between the dog and the cat.
  </em>
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  "<em>Sir," called the cook. "There seems to be a dog and a cat fighting under the podium? Should we call someone to stop them and chase them away?"</em>
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  "<em>Never mind. That is not our problem," said the chief. </em>
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  <em>
    Meanwhile the cat and the dog started chasing each other in the compound. They then went outside the compound still chasing each other. This alerted
    the owner of the cat who started beating the dog. On seeing this, the owner of the dog became infuriated, rushed out of his house and begun chasing and
    beating the cat. Soon, the two were beating each other.
  </em>
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  "<em>Sir," called the cook. "There are two people fighting out there. Why don't you send one of your guards to separate them?"</em>
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  "<em>Never mind. It is not our problem. There are administrative police out there and they will do that." </em>
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  <em>
    As this went on, the friends of the cat's owner gathered and begun to cheer him on. On seeing this, the friends of the dog's owner also gathered and
    begun to cheer him on as well. Soon the two groups entered the fight and begun to fight and attack each other.
  </em>
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  "
  <em>
    Sir," the cook called again. "The commotion seems to be growing bigger. It is as if people are now fighting in the streets. Perhaps you should send
    your guards to break this up."
  </em>
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  <em>
    Soon, the area sub-chief arrived on the scene of the conflict. At first, he tried to break the fight but when he heard the cause of the fight, he sided
    with the cat's owner. Some people who were siding with the dog's owner rushed to the chief's office and called him. He was in a meeting with some
    elders. When he heard of the commotion, he together with the elders and his administrative police rushed to the scene. When they arrived at the scene,
    the chief and some elders and two of his administrative police sided with the dog's owner. Others sided with the cat's owner and the war intensified.
    Soon, the whole area was in chaos. The supporters of the cat's owner started burning houses believed to belong to supporters of the dog's owner. On
    seeing this, the supporters of the dog's owner too started looting and burning houses belonging to supporters of the cat's owner. In a fraction of a
    second, the whole area was on fire. The fire had even started spreading to the rich man's house. The rich man was now infuriated. The skirmishes now
    threatened to spoil his party.
  </em>
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  "
  <em>
    What shall we do now?" asked the rich man as he rushed towards his burning house. It was however too late. The fire had engulfed the whole house before
    any help was forthcoming. He watched in disbelief bellows of fire rise in sky burning his house. He tried to make some calls through his mobile phone
    but no help was forthcoming.
  </em>
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  "<em>Perhaps," he murmured. "I was wrong?"</em>
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  "<em>Perhaps the drop of beer was the problem&#8230;or perhaps it was my problem." </em>
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  The teacher told me that he wanted to encourage pupils to volunteer information of pupils who are planning to cause conflicts in school. By telling the
  story the teacher hoped that pupils would fear risking like how the rich man risked by ignoring a small matter and taking a don't care attitude.
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  In another school, a teacher gave an incident where a boy had fought another over food. The school offers lunch to its pupils and some pupils like taking
  the lion's share. This at times ends up denying some pupils lunch. This is what had happened this day but degenerated into a fight. So the teacher gave
  this story of a greedy tortoise that broke its shell because it failed to consider others. The story also appears in Achebe's novel Things Fall Apart. The
  story went like this:
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  <em>
    Once upon a time there was famine in the animal kingdom, but only the birds were healthy because the King of Birds usually provides food for all birds
    every four days. When the tortoise realized that the famine was not affecting the birds, he decided to find out why. The tortoise went to the tree
    where the birds usually gathered before visiting their King and pleaded that they allow him to go with them. The birds being aware of the tricks of
    tortoise would not allow him but, after some persuasions, the birds accepted that tortoise would go with them and also donated wings for him to fly.
    Before they left they all took new names and tortoise was known as "All of You."
  </em>
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  <em>
    When they got to the palace of the King of Birds, the king welcomed them very well and different types of dishes were brought out and set before them.
    The tortoise rose and asked the king, "Who are these foods meant for?" The King replied, "All of you." Tortoise then reminded the birds of their new
    names, and that the foods were for him. He then told the birds to go home. This annoyed the birds and each of them demanded and collected the wings
    that were donated to tortoise.
  </em>
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  <em>
    The tortoise was then stranded in the sky and could not come back, but he sent word to his wife through the parrot. He told the tortoise's wife to
    bring out their mattress and all soft materials in their house, so that when he dropped from the sky, he wouldn't hurt himself. But the parrot gave a
    contrary message to tortoise's wife to bring out stones, hard objects, hoes and machetes. When the tortoise weighed that the wife should have brought
    out all the materials, he then dropped from the sky onto the hard materials. The tortoise's shell broke into pieces and his wife tried to put them back
    the way they were before the fall, but she could not. This is why tortoise's shell looks cracked. That's the end of my story.
  </em>
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  Two teachers however suggested that they do not employ indigenous knowledge in transforming conflicts in school. One said that there are different ethnic
  groups and she does not know how to apply indigenous knowledge from those other ethnic groups. The other teacher said that conflicts are handled by the
  head teacher and his deputy.
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  The responses also showed that teachers were in agreement that indigenous approach to peace building was successful in addressing the problem in schools.
  They however suggested that indigenous approaches be used together with the contemporary approaches such as counseling to make them more effective.
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  I used the interviews and observations to confirm the responses given in the questionnaires. In one school for instance, I observed a teacher resolving
  some conflicts. When I arrived at the school, the headmaster was not in the office. I therefore went to the staff-room to enquire where he was. In the
  staffroom I met a teacher and two pupils. The two pupils were crying and the teacher was talking to them. From what I gathered from their discussion, the
  two pupils had fought and the teacher was trying to make them understand they had done wrong and that they should never repeat the mistake again. In their
  conversation, the teacher was using some proverbs to warn pupils never to fight again in class. Speaking in Kiswahili, the teacher used the proverb "majuto
  ni mjukuu" meaning that their behaviour (fighting) had made them to be punished.
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  In another school, one teacher demonstrated how she uses handclap to transform conflicts in her class. She said that if a child causes some conflicts, she
  at times requests pupils to clap for her <em>'ngome,'</em> that is, instead of clapping the normal way; they use the back of the hand to clap. This
  according to the teacher is meant to disapprove the behaviour of the pupil. This concurs with what Augsburger (n.d) observes, that "the awareness of
  disapproval or rejection by the social context of significant peers can shape behaviour, control choices, silence differences and conceal conflicts" (p.
  82).
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  Roberts (1979) illustrates how shame could be used to shape behaviour. Among the Merina people of Madagascar, if a crime say, for instance theft is
  committed and the identity of the thief is not known, the public shaming process is carried out as a part of normal conversations. People sitting in the
  meeting place or market place, speak ruefully and pointedly of the evils of stealing in general, and of the recent event in particular, expressing their
  sadness at what has happened and their hope that it will not occur again. As this continues, persistently from day to day, the impact becomes too intense
  for the wrongdoer to face and desists from the disapproved behaviour (p. 62). By making pupils censor and disapprove the behaviour of the other pupils, the
  teacher is able to set a standard of behaviour that can enhance a harmonious co-existence in class.
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  <a name="_Toc145741934"></a>
  Another teacher said that they employ indigenous knowledge during pastoral reflection sessions. The school has pastoral reflections on Wednesdays. During
  this session, they invite resource persons to come and speak to the pupils. Among those invited include respected elders in the community and church
  leaders. They discuss various topics that revolve around living in harmony with one another. The resource persons normally employ proverbs or stories to
  reinforce their advice to pupils.
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  Incidents where Teachers have used the Knowledge in peace building
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  The study also sought to identify incidents where teachers have employed indigenous knowledge in peace building. The question was concerned with
  understanding teachers' personal experience in using indigenous knowledge in peace building. Can teachers recall incidents where they have employed
  indigenous knowledge in peace building? What was the nature of the problem and how did they resolve the problem? Thirty eight teachers responded to the
  question. On the nature of the problem, some of the responses included:

<ol>
  <li>
    <p lang="en-US" align="justify">
      Discussion approach: teacher discussed with the whole class on how great grandparents used dialogue to build peace.

      Advice approach: teacher called the pupils and advised them on what to do when one wrongs another, not taking law in their own hands.

  </li>
</ol>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  The responses reveal three important virtues about indigenous peace building. One, peacemaking is primarily about hearing and helping pupils understand
  what is right and wrong. By discussing the problem with the pupils to establish what is right and wrong, it suggests that the intervention 'removes' the
  offending behaviour of pupils from an 'offense framework' and places it within an educational and/healthy framework. The approach here can be conceived as
  a form of moral education and hearing rather than as a method of punishment. Unlike punishment that creates stigma, the approach makes the offender regain
  the respect s/he could have lost by committing an offence.
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  Two, peace building is based on relationships. As Gbodossou (2002) observes, in the African way, the individual exists, but only in relationship to the
  group. So when something happens to one, it happens to all. Whether good or bad, whatever happens to one happens to all (p. 1). By inviting parents to
  discuss the problem with the pupils, it means that peace making uses the deep emotions of respect, solidarity, and ties to the family and the community.
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  This suggests that we are all substantially the products of our relationships. Wrongdoing is therefore seen as a clue signaling relational disharmonies.
  When one does wrong, s/he shames even the relationships that surround him. Only people who understand the complexities of their relationships thoroughly
  enough are actually involved. The role of the parent is to act as the regulator of respectful processes, teacher of values upon which respectful
  relationships can be developed, and to provide real-life demonstrations of what those relationships look like in action. Peacemaking therefore involves all
  the people in the web of relationships that surround every offender.

<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  <strong>Teachers Motivation to employ indigenous peace knowledge in peace building</strong>
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  The study went further to explore what motivates teachers to employ indigenous knowledge in building peace. This was done through a questionnaire and the
  interviews. Motivation in this study entails the way teachers value indigenous peace knowledge, their perceptions, interpretations and patterns of
  self-direction and regulation of action. The study assumed that motivation influences how teachers perceive a conflict situation, how they address the
  conflict and how they interpret their performance.
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  The study revealed that there are various sources of motivation that make teachers employ indigenous knowledge in peace building. Their responses suggested
  that most of the teachers are motivated by the effectiveness of indigenous knowledge in peace building. One teacher put it this way: "Because the method
  was used on me by my elders and it worked I also use it on my pupils because it is effective."
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  It was also noted that the knowledge encourages pupils to participate in classroom discussions and in seeking solutions to the quarrels and disagreement
  that arise between them. The knowledge also discourages tribalism in school. This is because by employing indigenous knowledge from different ethnic
  communities in class pupils learn to appreciate other cultures.
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  Values embedded in this knowledge were ranked second in motivating teachers to employ the indigenous knowledge in peace building. One teacher suggested
  that the moral values embedded in indigenous stories and proverbs may not be available in the formal school curriculum. Teachers identify with this
  knowledge because they know it, they have been brought up in it and are used to it. This concurs with Batiste (1949) who observes that indigenous knowledge
  provides the deep cognitive bonds that affect all aspects of indigenous life. Through their shared language, indigenous people create a shared belief in
  how the world works and what constitutes proper action. Sharing these common ideals creates the collective cognitive experience of indigenous societies,
  which is understood as indigenous knowledge (p.49).
</p>

  Another teacher said that she uses indigenous knowledge in peace building because it is polite. He said that indigenous knowledge tries to stay away from
  labels like "a thief," or "a criminal." These kinds of labels have a tendency to stigmatize people and make it difficult to build peace. As Ross (1996)
  observes, the choice of staying away from labels is connected to an understanding that all life is a process, that every person is seen as a
  "thing-which-is-becoming" as opposed to a "thing-which-is." Whenever we use labels like the "offender," we tend to deny that understanding of constant
  change (p. 101).
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  The simplicity and the relaxing nature of indigenous knowledge were ranked third in motivating teachers to employ it in building peace. One teacher said
  that when using indigenous knowledge, pupils tend to be attentive and make it easy for teachers to employ the knowledge. As noted elsewhere in this
  chapter, this knowledge is not written down. It is clearly known to both the teachers and the pupils. It is stated everywhere, in every activity, at
  virtually every hour of the day. It is embedded in the structure of their language. Teachers therefore find it easy to employ the knowledge in promoting
  peace. It also releases tension in class because pupils do participate in sharing their experiences.

  <strong>Challenges in using the indigenous Knowledge in Peace Building</strong>
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  The study sought to identify challenges that hinder teachers from employing this knowledge in building peace in schools effectively. A number of challenges
  were highlighted. Diversity of ethnic backgrounds was identified as a major challenge in employing indigenous knowledge in peace building. Some teachers
  explained that different communities have different views regarding peace building. For instance, some communities may consider circumcision as an
  initiative to build peace in that it makes an individual more responsible and accountable to the society. This may not be so in those communities that do
  not practice circumcision. What a particular community considers as an appropriate way of building peace may not be appropriate in another community. One
  teacher put it this way:
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  <em>
    Every ethnic group has its own way of promoting peace so when you teach them ways of promoting peace in some African traditions, some pupils disagree
    with you. So we find it very difficult to convince them.
  </em>
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  Language barrier was also identified as a challenge. At times, it requires one to use an indigenous language to fully approximate the intended meaning
  latent in an indigenous expression. Many pupils have not mastered their mother tongues well. At the same time, many teachers are limited to one indigenous
  language - their mother tongues, hence are unable to employ knowledge from other ethnic groups. This leads to another problem of making the indigenous
  knowledge of the teacher more superior than other languages.
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  Pupils' background was also noted as a challenge in employing indigenous knowledge in peace building. One teacher argued that some pupils have been brought
  up in a Christian background and they consider indigenous practices as 'paganism.' She gave an example of when she was in secondary school. In their
  school, they used to have inter-house competition where students would organize some cultural dances for competition. She said she normally exempted
  herself from such activities because they went against her religious beliefs. She however observed that there is much in common between African traditions
  and Christianity.
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  Traditionally, the teacher noted, if there were problems in the family or the community such as sickness, elders would slaughter a bull and everyone
  participated in sharing this meal. Women would fetch water, young girls would fetch firewood, and elders would send young boys for errands. Once the meals
  were ready, the whole community would come together to eat. Elders would then offer prayers for the whole community. Today, the teacher ensures that a
  joint prayer is made before she starts the class and before they leave for home.
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  Parents were also blamed for being an obstacle in employing indigenous knowledge in peace building. Some teachers complained that some parents do not
  accept that their children are in the wrong. They side with their children thus complicating peace-building initiatives. This denies peace building the
  relational goodwill that comes about when respect and ties to the family and age comes in as a regulator of peace building. Related to this, some teachers
  suggested that some parents do not counsel their children. They felt that parents have a role to play in building peace in schools. If parents do not join
  hands with the teachers then peace building becomes difficult.
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  Lack of resources was also noted as a major challenge in employing indigenous knowledge. Some teachers complained that there are no adequate learning and
  teaching materials on indigenous knowledge. They also felt that there is a lack of good resource persons to help in building peace in schools. This has
  been brought about by the fact that traditional authority figures such as elders and the parents are increasingly rendered irrelevant by the apparent power
  of the media to shape youth's values and beliefs.
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  Frequency of conflicts in schools was also noted as a challenge in employing indigenous knowledge in peace building. Teachers were of the view that peace
  building is a process that requires a lot of creativity and time to sustain. When many conflicts such as theft, fighting and other wrong behaviours that
  disturb smooth running of the school occur at the same time, they do not have time to think of the best approach to resolve the conflict. They instead
  resort to punishment as the only way to deal with a conflict. This denies the peace building process of the values which guide it. A typical statement is
  that punishment responds to the 'hurt' of wrongdoing with the 'hurt' of punishment. That is, if the wrongdoing was serious, then punishment is serious. A
  peace building process is however, guided by the value of healing. It removes the offending behaviour of pupils from a 'criminal framework' and places it
  within an educational or/healthy framework (Moore 1983).

  <strong>How Teachers Overcome the Challenges </strong>
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  The study sought to explore how teachers try to overcome the challenges of building peace in schools through indigenous peace knowledge. This was done
  through a questionnaire and the interviews. Teachers suggested various ways through which they try to overcome these challenges. Some suggested that they
  include parents in peace building by inviting them to school when resolving conflicts. One teacher put it this way:
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  <em>
    When I invite a parent to discuss a discipline case of his/her child, I address the parent first. I make the parent understand the nature of the
    problem and the consequences of the problem both to the pupil and the parent and the wider society. In so doing, I try to impress on the parent the
    need to counsel his/her child. When doing this, I employ proverbs and other indigenous expressions so as to make the parent realize that s/he has a
    role to play in peace building.
  </em>
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  To others, they discuss indigenous peace values with pupils during classroom debates. During these debates, pupils also participate in sharing their
  knowledge on indigenous peace traditions through narrating stories they have heard from their parents or relatives.
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  On the ethnic differences, teachers suggested that they encourage pupils to live in peace. They teach pupils that there is no ethnic difference in God's
  eyes. Another teacher said that he tries to overcome the challenge by urging pupils to be proud of their indigenous cultures. He said, "I always try to
  convince them that we are African and we should not leave the indigenous peace enjoyed by our forefathers." Related to this, a teacher said that he tries
  to make pupils realize the damage done to Africans by the western cultures.
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  <em>
    I have always enjoyed and explained on how western style of life has destroyed our Africa. Sophisticated weapons made by westerners have also brought a
    lot of conflicts in Africa.
  </em>
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  One teacher said that he overcomes the challenges by comparing indigenous societies with the contemporary society. He compares the kind of foods eaten by
  our forefathers, how they lived together and the kind of solidarity they had in society in order to make pupils realize how African traditions were.

  <strong>Conclusion</strong>
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
  The analysis of the responses derived from the study reveals that teachers are able to generate meaning about peace. This meaning is derived from their
  interaction with the grassroots people and their indigenous traditions. The meaning derived is in concord with the existing social meaning about peace. The
  social meaning in this case refers to the already prescribed meaning about peace that has been passed on from generation to generation. Teachers have
  internalized these meanings and use this understanding to build peace in schools. This study also revealed that the meaning generated by teachers
  influences how they employ indigenous knowledge in building peace in schools. There are however some challenges but teachers have various approaches of
  overcoming them.
