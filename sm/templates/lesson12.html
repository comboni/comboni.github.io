    Progress towards peace
  </div>
  <p class="item item-text-wrap">
    This entails the presence of well-publicized, palpable movement towards conflict resolution that includes negotiation with the rival. </p>

    Support for peace process 
  </div>
  <p class="item item-text-wrap">
    This is important because it legitimizes peace education. According to Bar-Tar and Rosen (2009), children and adolescents bring to school views of their parents and community and when a majority of society members do not support the peace process peace education is met with distrust and hostility.

    Ripeness for reconciliation 
  </div>
  <p class="item item-text-wrap">
    This relates to community’s readiness to change their conflict-related repertoire which includes collective memory and ethos of conflict. It also relates to the openness of the society to alternative messages and the tolerance to hear them. Without this ripeness for reconciliation, peace education will be hard to successfully implement (Bar-Tar Rosen, 2009).

    Government/political support. 
  </div>
  <p class="item item-text-wrap">
     According to (Bar-Tar and Rosen, 2009), peace education can succeed when peace education as a policy is formally supported by leaders because they see it as a very important part of their peace oriented policy. This support communicates to the public a high government commitment to and priority for peace. This concurs with Akala’s (2007) observation regarding the role education stakeholder politics play in determing the general direction and quality of any system of education. According to Bar-Tal (2002), objectives of peace education may be perceived as a threat to a particular group, several groups, or even society as a whole. Some groups may perceive the the objectives of peace education as a threat to traditional cultural values or even the order of the social system. For instance,  Shenk (2009) gives an example of an NGO that was conducting peace education in Eldoret after the post-election violence which was rebuffed by local authorities and demanded that they identify themselves.

    Ministerial support 
  </div>
  <p class="item item-text-wrap">
     This refers to the support from the highest educational authority and renders the mission legitimate and creates a climate in educational system that is conducive to the institutionalization of peace education. It also rallies the support of the leaders of the educational system and provides teachers with legitimization and an incentive (Bar-Tar and Rosen, 2009).

    Well-defined peace education policy
  </div>
  <p class="item item-text-wrap">
The policy should be well defined with detailed planning on how to carry out peace education. It should also have both short-term and long-term programs. According to Bar-Tar and Rosen (2009), short-term programs should be seen as emergency programs that can satisfy the immediate needs of the changing situations until the long-term programs are ready and can be implemented. The long-term programs are supposed to construct the new culture of peace and are reflected in new curricula and new school text books, in the development of new programs and in the development of new training curricular for teachers, school principals and school staff.   </p>

    Peace education authority
  </div>
  <p class="item item-text-wrap">
According to Amamio (2004) noted in  (Bar-Tar and Rosen, 2009: 562) the Ministry of education need to have the authority as well as the infrustructure  and resources to impliment peace education. This also includes the availability of experts and professionals to help in the institutionalization of peace education in schools. According to Chinyere (2013) and Gachanga (2014), there are limited available research materials in the area of peace in Africa. They points out that majority of the materials available are of foreign origin and may not be absolutely used to reflect local peculiarities. This concurs with Najjuma (2011) who observes that there are few formal education initiatives undertaken at a central level in most of the African countries. Emerging initiatives are taken by countries in post-conflict reconstruction phases that intend to rebuild social cohesion and set foundations for lasting peace. However, these initiatives are undermined by lack of resources and are taken at the level of higher education.  </p>
