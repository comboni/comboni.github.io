	<br><br><i class="icon ion-record" style="font-size: 10px;"></i> &nbsp;Wide spread destruction, killings, rapes and amputations left the country physically decimated and its population psychologically traumatized after 11 years civil war.
	July 1999, the government and the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) signed Lome Accord that offered rebels amnesty for the atrocities they had committed during the war. This was an inducement to get them to lay down their arms.
	<br><br><i class="icon ion-record" style="font-size: 10px;"></i> &nbsp;Lome Accord also mandated the establishment of Truth and Reconciliation Commission.

<br><br>Underutilization of tradition at the TRC Commission
<br><br><i class="icon ion-record" style="font-size: 10px;"></i> &nbsp;War had occasioned mass movement of people from rural areas to larger towns/or campms which made the practice of cultural traditions difficult
<br><br><i class="icon ion-record" style="font-size: 10px;"></i> &nbsp;Rebels frequently targeted traditional leaders, defiled sacred places in the bush where secret societies met, and destroyed shrines and ceremonial objects
<br><br><i class="icon ion-record" style="font-size: 10px;"></i> &nbsp;Too many chiefs and village elders had been implicated in the conflict. Chiefs were corrupt, imposed excessive cash levies, allocated land unfairly, and required forced labour and punished dissenters. People felt marginalized and led to bitterness. Example: chiefs had multiple wives while young men could not afford even one, dooming them to the status of “youth”infidelity and deepening their social shame.

    Sierra Leone: A Superordinate Goals Approach
  </div>
  <p class="item item-text-wrap">
    The recent war in Sierra Leone began as a spillover from the war in neighboring Liberia and ran from 1991 until May 2001. Animated in no small part by a struggle to control areas rich in resources such as timber and diamonds (Richards 1996), the war was notorious for its bloodiness, including the amputation of civilians’ limbs by machete-wielding soldiers, some of whom were children. The war displaced large numbers of people, devastated infrastructure, and left in its wake a population that had the shortest life expectancy of any UN member state.
<br><br>The war created powerful needs of community reconciliation in two complementary respects. Intercommunally, the war forced neighboring villages into a harsh competition to meet survival needs, such as those of food, water, and shelter. In place of former inter-village activities and attitudes that “my neighbors are my friends,” the war created a spirit of distrust and isolation that was inimical to civil society. Intracommunally, villagers harbored deep fears about what would happen when the soldiers returned home. Particularly feared were the numbers of the former rebel group, the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), who had committed many war-time atrocities and who were often seen as blood thirsty predators and troublemakers. Even parents feared that their formerly recruited sons and daughters, many of whom engaged in unruly behavior and abused alcohol and other substances, might kill them. Community people doubted that former RUF members, including children, were capable of being contributing citizens. These fears and doubts, coupled with concerns about reprisal attacks against the former RUF members, created the need to reconcile returning former soldiers with community members. Also, some adults feared that the intergroup fighting during the war between the RUF and the village militias that had sprung up to oppose the RUF would be played out in the villages. Indeed, in the Northern Province, former child soldiers who had fought on the opposing sides were returning to the villages, and few plans were in place to reduce intergroup tensions. In this respect, there was a strong need to reconcile members of formerly opposed groups with each other.
<br><br>To address this situation, CCF/Sierra Leone used a superordinate goal approach aimed at defusing tensions and building positive intergroup relations through cooperation on a shared goal (Deutsch 2000: Sherif et al.1961). The work focused on the Northern Province since this region had been the RUF stronghold at the end of the war, experienced ongoing intergroup and intercommunal tensions, and had significant numbers of formerly recruited children returning home. CCF focused on the well-being of young people because this was within their agency mandate on supporting children’s healthy development and protection. Also, although some programs had been set up in the region to support the reintegration of adult former soldiers, there were relatively few supports for children. The initial focus was on the formerly recruited boys since they posed the greatest threat to security, yet in other projects, the focus was on the integration of formerly recruited girls (Wessel, 2006). CCF worked through staff who were in Sierra Leone and understood the local language, culture and situation.
