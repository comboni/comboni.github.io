    Introduction
  </div>
  <p class="item item-text-wrap">
    In December 2007 and into 2008, Kenya experienced unprecedented ethnic violence that erupted after the disputed general elections. The elections sparked chaos that escalated into a violent conflict, putting supporters of the former President Mwai Kibaki (a Kikuyu) against those of challenger Raila Odinga (a Luo), who was later named prime minister in a power-sharing agreement  (Gachanga2012a). Over 1,200 Kenyans were reported killed, thousands more injured, over 300,000 people displaced from their communities and around 42,000 houses and many businesses were looted or destroyed. A significant number of cases of sexual violence were also reported (UNHCR 2008). The violence not only shattered the foundations of Kenya as a nation, but also painted a picture of a country severely fractured by ethnic cleavages. <br><br>

	Many scholars attribute this to the failure of the nation-building project in Kenya (Branch et al. 2010:244-5). While Kenya had been perceived as a strong democratizing country, its institutions of governance remained weak, fragmented, corrupt and unable to deal with underlying causes of conflict and the emerging violence. Successive Kenyan regimes politicized and “ethnicized” state institutions and used the various offices as political tools for maintaining a system of ethnic patronage. Corruption at the highest level of governance created political, economic, and social barriers between citizens and their rulers (Otieno 2009). As a consequence, a profound level of distrust and fear was created between some of the forty-two ethnic groups that make up the Kenyan population, causing old barriers to resurface and deepen. As a consequence, many citizens are deeply ignorant of one another’s histories and cultures, and have erected imaginary walls between ethnic communities, failing to appreciate the shared histories, narratives, memories, cultural practices and values that both unite them and contribute to the amazing diversity of Kenyan arts and culture (Hughes 2011).<br><br>

	As a consequence, the Government of Kenya through the Ministry of Education Science and Technology (MoEST) introduced compulsory peace education in schools in 2008. According to Kang'ethe (2012), the aim of introducing the programme was to create awareness among learners on the causes of conflicts and how to resolve them amicably. It also aimed at preparing learners to become good citizens and use the classroom as a springboard through which values of positive interdependence, social justice and participation in decision-making processes are learnt and practiced. In addition, it aimed at fostering respect for diversity.</p>

  	In 2012, MoEST and other education stakeholders started working on peace education policy. In January 2014, the peace education policy was signed by the Cabinet Secretary.  It mandated peace education to be integrated and infused in all teaching subjects and in co-curriculum activities.

    Education Sector Policy on Peace Education 
  </div>
  <p class="item item-text-wrap">
    Kenya is a signatory to a number of International treaties and conventions that peaceful and harmonious co-existence among people of all nations. Of significance to these treaties include the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) Article 26(2) that states that education should promote understanding, tolerance and friendship among all nations. According to (MoEST, 2014), the policy contributes to the actualization of Kenya’s commitment to the treaty. African Ministers of Education have also committed their Governments to promotion of peace education and training as is reflected in the Mombasa and Naivasha communiqués signed in 2008 and 2012 respectively (MoEST, 2014). <br><br>

	The peace education policy takes cognizance of other legal and policy documents that have been put in place by the government of Kenya. Among the legal and policy documents documents relevant to the peace education proramme include:
